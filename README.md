Using the neuralnet package in R for machine learning classification


Here we make a neural network deep learning model to classify which brewery crafted which wine, based on variables describing the chemistry of the wine.
The model performance is stunningly good: Accuracy=96%

Follow the guide and copy/paste my code to replicate this example and learn. Enjoy!
The dataset is available online and url is provided in R script.
